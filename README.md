# LOST FREQUENCY

## Overview

Lost Frequency is a little web-based game that uses your unique identifier to provide you with a little section of code that is scrambled that you have to decode and send to the server and all other clients to decipher the hidden message.

This obviously means that it requires multiple people to complete the final message so let's hope that everyone that plays this can submit their decoded message and figure it out!

## Other info

Just in case you are curious this server uses:

- NodeJS + ws + express
- Vite + Typescript
- tailwindcss and raw css at this point

I think this is going to be the coolest project that I have ever made in my coding existance!

### What is the fingerprint?

The fingerprint system works by using your GPU to render some items using webgl so that I can create a unique fingerprint about you, this means only you get one piece of the puzzle and can't get muliple pieces of the puzzle.

Because it is highly illegal to get a fingerprint without consent, I HAVE to put a consent thing before you I render your print >:(
