			<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
			<p>Effective date: <strong>October 14, 2025</strong></p>

			<section>
				<h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
				<p>By using this website to view, register, or cast votes you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the site. Use of the site requires explicit consent to data collection described below.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>2. What we collect</h2>
				<p>To reduce duplicate or fraudulent votes we collect a minimal set of device signals after you give explicit consent. The signals we may collect include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Canvas rendering sample data (small, sampled byte values)</li>
					<li>WebGL renderer string and basic graphics capability indicators (e.g., max texture size)</li>
					<li>Optional minimal metadata: browser user-agent and time zone (only when you consent)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We do not collect raw images, full pixel dumps, or other unnecessary personal data. We do not link these signals to personal identifiers unless you explicitly provide them (for example, by creating an account or confirming identity via an alternate verification method).</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>3. How we use collected data</h2>
				<p>We use the collected device signals solely to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Detect and limit duplicate or automated votes</li>
					<li>Issue short-lived voting tokens for valid sessions</li>
					<li>Maintain the integrity and reliability of the voting process</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We NEVER sell device signals to third parties for advertising. Aggregated, anonymized metrics may be used for system monitoring and improvement.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>4. Consent and alternatives</h2>
				<p>We will only collect the device signals after you explicitly consent (for example, by checking a consent box or accepting a modal). If you refuse consent you will be offered an alternative verification method (email, SMS, or manual verification) so you can still participate in the vote.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>5. Storage, hashing, and retention</h2>
				<p>Client-side values are hashed locally before transmission. On our servers we re-hash with a server-side secret (salt) and store only the hashed value and a short-lived token. Retention rules:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We purge expired tokens and hashes regularly.</li>
					<li>We retain minimal audit logs related to vote integrity for a limited period to investigate disputes.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>6. Security</h2>
				<p>We use industry-standard security measures (HTTPS, server-side hashing, access controls). However no system is perfectly secure. We treat fingerprint hashes and tokens as sensitive data and protect them accordingly.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>7. Accessibility and blocking</h2>
				<p>Some browsers or privacy tools block or randomize canvas/WebGL data. If your browser prevents collection of these signals we will provide an alternative verification flow. We will not attempt to circumvent browser privacy protections.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>8. Your rights</h2>
				<p>You may:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Request a copy of the data we hold about your voting session.</li>
					<li>Request deletion of your data where permitted by law (note: deletion may affect the ability to resolve disputes related to a past vote).</li>
					<li>Opt out of device-signal collection and use the provided alternative verification.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To exercise these rights contact: <a href="mailto:baileyleah542@gmail.com">baileyleah542@gmail.com</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>9. Liability</h2>
				<p>We make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy and security of the voting process. To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use of the site, including losses caused by software bugs, browser incompatibilities, or attacker actions.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>10. Changes to these Terms</h2>
				<p>We may update these Terms. Material changes will be posted with an updated effective date and, where appropriate, notified to users. Your continued use after a change constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
			</section>
